          Based on Bacteriophage viruses We will use their structure to carry
          the genetic code that will produce interplanetary life in different
          spaces. For the synthesis of this genome we will start with the
          Deinococcus radiodurans genome, since it is the organism capable of
          resisting radiation and survive in conditions of heat, cold,
          dehydration, vacuum and acid. Under technologies such as
          nanotechnology, we will add TiO2 nanoparticles to its structure to
          resist cosmic radiation, temperature and other conditions.
